This library is in use on [TriviaBot](https://triviabot.co.uk/) and [Sporks bot](https://sporks.gg).

## Documentation

The documentation is a work in progress, generated from the code comments and markdown using Doxygen.

#### [View D++ library documentation](https://dpp.brainbox.cc/)

## Supported Systems

The library runs great on **Linux**. **Windows** is also supported and we offer ready made compiled DLL and LIB files for easy integration into any windows visual studio 2019 project.
**Mac OS X** is also functional and stable, as is running your bot on a **Raspberry Pi** - we offer a prebuilt .deb for ARM64, ARM6 and ARM7 to save on having to wait for it to compile.

The library may work fine in other operating systems too, if you run a D++ bot on something not listed here please let us know!
